MGLC is a token BEP20 and with MGLC, users network costs are reduced and users can use it to invest by saving on these costs.  As mentioned above, users can have your own apps and games on MGL platform, and this way users can earn MGLC.

Metaverse Mgl users can also consider prizes such as digital assets as like MGLC token, NFT products, Avatar Products and Land for competitions. 
Game organizers and owners can cover the costs and prizes of the games from the MGLC that other users pay to participate in the competitions.
