Metaverse MGL is a virtual reality platform powered by Binance Smart chain Blockchain. When users want to use the MGL platform to produce content or apps and games or when users want to buy land, application and game or others products, users need to pay for network. therefor they need users a digital asset.
From the beginning, Metaverse Mgl sought to reduce the cost of MGL network users. The low cost of Binance Smart Chian Network transactions, its security and scalability were the reason for choosing this network to build MGLC platform and tokens in this network. 
MGLC is a token BEP20 and with MGLC, users network costs are reduced and users can use it to invest by saving on these costs. As mentioned above, users can have their own apps and games on this platform, in this way users can earn MGLC. 
If users decide to design a game, they have the ability to do that and engage in the tournament, also users can upload games in the online tournament section and there are online competitions for usersâ€™ enjoyment.
Metaverse Mgl users can also consider prizes such as digital assets similar to MGLC tokens, NFT products, Avatar Products and Land for competitions. 
Game organizers and owners can cover the costs and prizes of the games from the MGLC that other users pay to participate in the competitions.
finally, to have the MGL platform, we have started designing the necessary structure, protocols and standards, which will be introduced later.
